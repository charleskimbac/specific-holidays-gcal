# DEPRECATED - feature now officially supported
As of Feb 2025, Google Calendar **finally** allows users to choose which entries for public holidays and national observances they want shown.  
Add Calendar > Browse calendars of interest > Regional holidays

# specific-holidays-gcal
specific-holidays-gcal is for those who want to use Google Calendar's regional holiday calendars but only want to show specific holidays instead of all of the included holidays.

For example, GCal's "Holidays in United States" calendar includes many different holidays, but if you only want your calendar to show New Year's Day and Valentine's Day, then this makes that possible.
